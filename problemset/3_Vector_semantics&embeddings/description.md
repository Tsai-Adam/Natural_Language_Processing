# Using Doc2Vec to Map Documents onto the Vector Space

## Context

This project uses the [`ai_in_finance.json`](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/NLP-orgs-markets/blob/master/sampleData/econNewspaper/ai_in_finance.json) dataset, which contains over 4,000 articles on AI and financial services from The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times.

For a full description of the corpus, refer to:  
[Lanzolla, Gianvito, Simone Santoni, and Christopher Tucci. "Unlocking value from AI in financial services: strategic and organizational tradeoffs vs. media narratives." In Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Value Creation.

## Problem Statement

- **Objective:**  
  Use the doc2vec algorithm to generate document-level representations for all articles in the corpus.
- **Visualization:**  
  Visualize the position of individual documents in the vector space (similar to dimensionality reduction with BoW/TFIDF approaches).
- **Comparison:**  
  Compare and contrast the clustering or similarity results from doc2vec with those obtained via BoW or TFIDF.
