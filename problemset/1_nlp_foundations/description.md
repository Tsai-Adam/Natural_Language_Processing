# Count Company Mentions

## Context

This project is based on the analysis of [`ai_in_finance.json`](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/NLP-orgs-markets/blob/master/sampleData/econNewspaper/ai_in_finance.json), a dataset containing over 4,000 articles on AI and financial services from The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times.

For more information on the dataset, refer to:  
[Lanzolla, Gianvito, Simone Santoni, and Christopher Tucci. "Unlocking value from AI in financial services: strategic and organizational tradeoffs vs. media narratives." Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Value Creation, Edward Elgar Publishing, 2021.](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/NLP-orgs-markets/blob/46dad729070a5125c95adc214abbec312cae7077/sampleData/econNewspaper/lanzolla_santoni_tucci.pdf)

## Problem Statement

- **Objective:**  
  Identify all companies mentioned in the articles and create a frequency table showing how many times each company is mentioned.

- **Tools:**  
  Using spaCy for named entity recognition (NER) is highly recommended.
